```

3. Open in editor and edit the [src/info/config.js](./src/info/config.js) file.

4. Add your resume as <resume.pdf> in place of [src/info/resume.pdf](./src/info/)

5. Edit [title](./public/index.html#L34) and meta [description](./public/index.html#L13) in [public/index.html](./public/index.html).

6. Change the URL in the [package.json](./package.json) file:

9. Congrats!! Your website is up and running. To see it live, visit:

```https

"https://<your-website-name>/

```

10. If you want to change some of the info, thumbnail image, profile pic and resume, you can do the following:

- Navigate to the "public" folder.

- There you will see "social-image.png", "resume.pdf", "leandrocorreia.png" and, inside the "src/" directory, you have "config.json".

- Make your own version and rename your thumbnail as "social-image.png", your profile picture as "profile-pic.png", your resume as "resume.pdf" and change the "config.json" as you please.
